------------------------------------------
#### There are two solutions (that I know of) for this:
* The easiest is just use the command `touch` to create the file and we need to
specify the name like this:
	```
	touch \"\\\?\$\*’KwaMe’\*\$\?\\\"
	```
* And the other way is just to create a temp file with whichever name you want
and rename it to "\?$*’KwaMe’*$?\"

> Let's not forget to include the '42' inside that file after completing the
previous steps.
