|               find_sh.sh              |
|:--------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory : ex02/             |
| Files to turn in : find_sh.sh         |
| Allowed functions : None              |

### TODO

* Write a command line that searches for all file names that end with **".sh"**
(without quotation marks) in the current directory and all its sub-directories.
It should display only the file names without the .sh.
* Examples of output:
	```
	$>./find_sh.sh | cat -e
	find_sh$
	file1$
	file2$
	file3$
	$>
	```
