## Exercise 07 : r_dwssap

|               Exercise 07             |
|---------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory : ex07/             |
| Files to turn in : r_dwssap.sh        |
| Allowed functions : None              |
| Notes : n/a                           |

### TODO

* Write a command line that displays the output of a cat __/etc/passwd__
command, removing comments, every other line starting from the second line,
reversing each login, sorted in reverse alphabetical order, and keeping only
logins between **FT_LINE1** and **FT_LINE2** included, and they must separated
by **", "** (without quotation marks), and the output must end with a **"."**.

* Example: Between lines 8 and 16, the result should be something like this :
```
$> ./r_dwssap.sh
sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_
	.$>
```

> Rigorously follow the order indicated in the instructions.
