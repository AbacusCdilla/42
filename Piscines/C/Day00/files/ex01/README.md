|---------------------------------------|
| Turn-in directory : ex01/             |
| Files to turn in : testDay00.tar      |
| Allowed functions : None              |

### TODO

* Create a file called testDay00 in your submission directory.
* Figure out a way for the output to look like this
(except for the “total 1” line):
```
$ ls -l
total 1
-r--r-xr-x  1 login wheel  40 Jun 1 23:42 testDay00
$
```
* Once you’ve achieved the previous steps, execute the following command to
create the file to be submitted: tar -cf testDay00.tar testDay00.

> Notes:
> 1. "login" and "wheel" will be respectively replaced by your login and
your group.
> 2. A year will be accepted instead of the time, on the timestamp of the
file.
