#### Skippable content

* We can skip the Exercises `03, 04, 05 & 06`, because in order to do those we
need to set-up a `Kerberos Server` for `03` and a `LDAP Server` for
`04, 05 & 06`. Maybe latter on we'll add all the steps for creating the Servers,
but for the meantime, we need to pass on this content unfortunately.

> NOTE: If by any chance you know how to set-up the required servers and are
willing to share the info, please do so :) that will be of great help since it
saves me time.
